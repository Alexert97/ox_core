## Installation

todo

~~Refer to our [documentation](https://overextended.github.io/docs/ox_core/) for installing and setting up ox_core on your server.~~

## Database

This project is designed to be used with [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/downloads/) and utilises [mariadb-connector-nodejs](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/mariadb-connector-nodejs).

## Third-party resources

When releasing a resource using the this framework _do not use the ox prefix_. This creates confusion about the creator of the resource, and causes conflicts between similarly named resources.

## Sample usage

todo

~~Refer to [ox_core-example](https://github.com/overextended/ox_core-example) for some sample code. This should give some idea of how to use player and vehicle refs.~~
